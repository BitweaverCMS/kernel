This file describes how to set up tescases for (Smarty)filters.
The 'TestBitSmartyFilter.php' is an input - output tester that feeds
the contents of a file to the function to be tested  (in the first paramter)
and compares what the function returns with another file.

Right now the tester is only set up to test smarty filters in the ../kernel/smarty_tiki
directory, but testing in other directories could be aded by refactoring the code.

Follow these steps to set up a new test:

1. Create a directory (if not allready present) that is named analogously
   to the filter you want to test:
   <filtertype>.<filtername>, e.g. prefilter.tr
   in the 'smarty_filter_tests' directory

1.5 'chmod' this directory so that it is writeable by your webserver,
    otherwise creation of the error file, useful for debugging,
    will not be possible.

2. Create a file in the created directory that should be used as input for 
   the test. Name it <arbitraryname>.input

3. Run the tests by directing your browser to http://<tikiproroot>/kernel/test

4. The test will fail, since there is no <arbitraryname>.output file.
   Instead a file named <arbitraryname>.error will be generated.
   <arbitraryname> is the same name as in point 2.

5. Inspect the <arbitraryname>.error file. If the output is the expected,
   you should rename the <arbitraryname>.error to <arbitraryname>.output.
   Running the test again (reloading the browser, should now be succesful).
   If the output is not the expected, correct the filter and continue from
   step 3.

You can add more test by creating more files in the directory created in 1.


Happy testing.
